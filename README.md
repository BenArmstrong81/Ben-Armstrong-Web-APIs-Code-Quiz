# Ben-Armstrong-WebAPI-Challenge

## Your Task
The obejective of this challenge was to creat a timed coding quiz game from scratch. This was to include; multiple-choice questions that will run in the browser along with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality: <br/>

## Grading Requirements
* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria.
* Application deployed at live URL.
* Application loads with no errors.
* Application GitHub URL submitted.
* GitHub repository contains application code.
* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.
* Application user interface style is clean and polished.
* Application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the Challenge instructions.
* Repository has a unique name.
* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
* Repository contains quality readme file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

## What I Learned
We focused on advanced JavaScript this week. 

With a focus on; DOM, setting attributes, appending, timer intervals, event listeners, preventing default, bubblings, local storage and keyboard events. 

Following on from last week, colaboration is definately key and to speak up and ask questions within the lectures.

## What Problems Did we Solve?
I created a HTML, CSS and README file from scratch. 
  
This was our 4th week and having a Christmas Break inbetween gave me the time to catchup and really take note of the previous few weeks and study where I struggled. This afforded me the ability at least to follow along.
